## Inspiration
Mental health is a serious issue, and to sum it up, mainly the mental health deteriorates due to isolation as there are many technologies that keeps you busy throughout your day and you won't even notice, you are socially isolated and marginalised from the society, which later has adverse effects.
To tackle this, I made a simple Todo-App, where in a user is required to create short tasks, mostly outdoor tasks, and complete them, you can pre-schedule the tomorrow's task as well complete the remaining tasks. 
There are some random suggestions in your tasks, where in it's your choice to complete them or leave them, make your day worth it and socialize.

### Features to be added
1) Chat feature
