## Inspiration

Mental health disorders are a real issue for both professionals and patients due to the complexity of the disease and limited resources. Unfortunately, COVID19 is a great challenge for mental healthcare and the demand for effective digital healthcare has peaked.
150 million Indians suffer from some form of mental illness of which only 30 million have consulted a therapist. This number is 450 million at the global level. Moreover, the pandemic has led to a large increase in the number of mental illness cases.
I was inspired by our reality as we all come to a moment of sadness, loneliness, depression, unmotivated... but we don't really pay attention to it consequences. The thing is that our mental health is really important, as important as our physical health. I was inspired by my own case, I've been through a difficult year and I first thought it wasn't a big deal, but now I am suffering of some memory trouble, heart problem, bad blood pressure. And as I can see in social media, a lot of people go through the same thing but aren't aware of the consequences
This past year, people have really had to face the reality of death. We live in a death-denial culture where we are more comfortable just ignoring death but by doing so, we also ignore those who are dying.
